Contained in this zip:

1) data
Data contains the input files for spectal clustering and k-means clustering.
Data also contains files for the outputs of each image in spectral clustering, with subfolders for the Manhattan and Euclidean outputs.

2) k_means_euclidean.py is used to perform k_means clustering based on Euclidean distance
3) k_means_manhattan.py is used to perform k_means clustering based on Manhattan distance

For 2 and 3, in order to try different images, the path in line 69 can be changed from ruby to football or hestain

4) spectral_clustering.py is used to run the spectral clustering algorithm to answer both questions 1 and 2 in this section
